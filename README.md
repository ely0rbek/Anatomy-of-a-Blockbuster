## Project Topic and Overview

Anatomy of a Blockbuster. 

This project explores a large collection of movie industry data to answer key questions about what makes a film successful:

* How do **budget levels** influence box office revenue?
* What is the relationship between **movie genre** and audience ratings?
* Do certain genres consistently outperform others in profitability?
* Have film revenues and ratings changed over time?
* Are there patterns linking **runtime**, **release year**, and success metrics?

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the factors that shape a movie's financial and critical performance. Using movie metadata, it examines several important indicators, including:

* **Budget**
* **Revenue**
* **Genre**
* **Runtime**
* **Release_year**
* **Vote_average (rating)**
* **Profitability (revenue – budget)**

Through statistical exploration and visualization, the project uncovers hidden trends behind cinematic hits and provides insights into the formula for a blockbuster.
